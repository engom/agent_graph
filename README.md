### Quickstart

Run directly in python

```sh
# At least one LLM API key is required
echo 'AWS_PROFILE=aws_profile' >> .env

# uv is recommended but "pip install ." also works
pip install uv
uv sync --frozen
# "uv sync" creates .venv automatically
source .venv/bin/activate
python src/run_service.py

# In another shell
source .venv/bin/activate
streamlit run src/streamlit_app.py
```

Run with docker

```sh
echo 'AWS_PROFILE=aws_profile' >> .env
docker compose watch
```

### Architecture Diagram

### Key Features

1. **LangGraph Agent**: A customizable agent built using the LangGraph framework.
1. **FastAPI Service**: Serves the agent with both streaming and non-streaming endpoints.
1. **Advanced Streaming**: A novel approach to support both token-based and message-based streaming.
1. **Content Moderation**: Implements LlamaGuard for content moderation (requires Groq API key).
1. **Streamlit Interface**: Provides a user-friendly chat interface for interacting with the agent.
1. **Multiple Agent Support**: Run multiple agents in the service and call by URL path
1. **Asynchronous Design**: Utilizes async/await for efficient handling of concurrent requests.
1. **Feedback Mechanism**: Includes a star-based feedback system integrated with LangSmith.
1. **Dynamic Metadata**: `/info` endpoint provides dynamically configured metadata about the service and available agents and models.
1. **Docker Support**: Includes Dockerfiles and a docker compose file for easy development and deployment.
1. **Testing**: Includes robust unit and integration tests for the full repo.

### Key Files

The repository is structured as follows:

- `src/agents/`: Defines several agents with different capabilities
- `src/schema/`: Defines the protocol schema
- `src/core/`: Core modules including LLM definition and settings
- `src/service/service.py`: FastAPI service to serve the agents
- `src/client/client.py`: Client to interact with the agent service
- `src/streamlit_app.py`: Streamlit app providing a chat interface
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone 
   cd 
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory. At least one LLM API key or configuration is required. See the [`.env.example` file](./.env.example) for a full list of available environment variables, including a variety of model provider API keys, header-based authentication, LangSmith tracing, testing and development modes, and OpenWeatherMap API key.

3. You can now run the agent service and the Streamlit app locally, either with Docker or just using Python. The Docker setup is recommended for simpler environment setup and immediate reloading of the services when you make changes to your code.

### Docker Setup

This project includes a Docker setup for easy development and deployment. The `compose.yaml` file defines two services: `agent_service` and `streamlit_app`. The `Dockerfile` for each is in their respective directories.

For local development, we recommend using [docker compose watch](https://docs.docker.com/compose/file-watch/). This feature allows for a smoother development experience by automatically updating your containers when changes are detected in your source code.

1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose (>=[2.23.0](https://docs.docker.com/compose/release-notes/#2230)) installed on your system.

2. Build and launch the services in watch mode:

   ```sh
   docker compose watch
   ```

3. The services will now automatically update when you make changes to your code:
   - Changes in the relevant python files and directories will trigger updates for the relevantservices.
   - NOTE: If you make changes to the `pyproject.toml` or `uv.lock` files, you will need to rebuild the services by running `docker compose up --build`.

4. Access the Streamlit app by navigating to `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser.

5. The agent service API will be available at `http://localhost:80`. You can also use the OpenAPI docs at `http://localhost:80/redoc`.

6. Use `docker compose down` to stop the services.

This setup allows you to develop and test your changes in real-time without manually restarting the services.

### Local development without Docker

You can also run the agent service and the Streamlit app locally without Docker, just using a Python virtual environment.

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```sh
   pip install uv
   uv sync --frozen
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Run the FastAPI server:

   ```sh
   python src/run_service.py
   ```

3. In a separate terminal, run the Streamlit app:

   ```sh
   streamlit run src/streamlit_app.py
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).


## Customization

To customize the agent for your own use case:

1. Add your new agent to the `src/agents` directory. You can copy `research_assistant.py` or `chatbot.py` and modify it to change the agent's behavior and tools.
1. Import and add your new agent to the `agents` dictionary in `src/agents/agents.py`. Your agent can be called by `/<your_agent_name>/invoke` or `/<your_agent_name>/stream`.
1. Adjust the Streamlit interface in `src/streamlit_app.py` to match your agent's capabilities.

## Building other apps on the AgentClient

The repo includes a generic `src/client/client.AgentClient` that can be used to interact with the agent service. This client is designed to be flexible and can be used to build other apps on top of the agent. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous invocations, and streaming and non-streaming requests.

See the `src/run_client.py` file for full examples of how to use the `AgentClient`. A quick example:

```python
from client import AgentClient
client = AgentClient()

response = client.invoke("Tell me a brief joke?")
response.pretty_print()

# A man walked into a library and asked the librarian, "Do you have any books on Pavlov's dogs and Schr√∂dinger's cat?"
# The librarian replied, "It rings a bell, but I'm not sure if it's here or not."

```
